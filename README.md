MLStone
=======

Machine Learning Game similar to HearthStone.

The idea is to make a very very simple version of this game to make agents play and learn from, perhaps explore balance issues, perhaps create better bots to play the game as, perhaps use as a best move predictor or just as a silly little fun project to mess around with in my free time.
